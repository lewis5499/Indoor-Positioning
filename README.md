The Navigation Engineering program offered by the School of Geodesy and Geomatics at Wuhan University includes three course internships in the course "Indoor Positioning Techniques":

Geometric positioning based on distance measurement - distance intersection.
Pedestrian trajectory estimation based on inertial sensors.
Database matching positioning - signal strength fingerprint recognition.

MATLAB was utilized in this project, and a complete code implementation has been provided.
